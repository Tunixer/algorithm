 * There is a critical point in the game. As is said in the Problem,
 * Out of 5 balanced bracket sequences with 3 good pairs,
 * there exists only one such sequence "((()))" with the good pair (2,5)
 * If we have 3 good pairs, it can make up to 5 balanced bracket sequences.
 *
 * [LeetCode 22](https://leetcode.cn/problems/generate-parentheses/) gives this conclusion.
 * But the more difficult thing is that the number of good pairs is not 3, but 5000.
